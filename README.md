  The Base color is black, if you don't have any extension to make `VSC Window` transparent/blur, it just black.

This CSS file is developed for simplified Chinese. If you use other languages, please change it by yourself.

**I use the returned content of the google font api to integrate `Fira Code` and `Product Sans` (which means that fonts will be obtained online). `Product Sans` are not allowed for commercial use (maybe unauthorized use is not legal).**
